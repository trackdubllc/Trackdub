# PR Ready Loop

Drives a change from a dirty working tree to a merge-ready pull request, with every claim backed by a command that actually ran. The loop is deliberately sequential: local validation is cheap and runs first, the Release warnings-as-errors gate runs before anything is published, and no commit is created until the gate is green. The governing rule is that a red PR is never cheaper than a false one — if a gate fails, the loop stops.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use when:
- A change exists in the working tree or on a branch and must become mergeable.
- Review threads need triage and a fix loop.
- A PR's CI checks must be watched to completion.
- A fix must land on a base branch before the dependent change can merge (stacked PRs).

Do NOT use for:
- Adding a pipeline stage → `new-inference-stage.md` first, then this workflow.
- A performance regression → `benchmark-regression-triage.md`.
- A native dependency bump → `/pin` via `.opencode/context/processes/submodule-pin-bump.md`.
- Reading-only question about the codebase. Do not open a PR.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target branch | yes | Branch the change lands on, usually `main` | `main` |
| Scope | yes | What is in this change, in one sentence | none |
| Linear issue | no | Issue id in workspace `trackdubllc`, team **TS**, project `repo:core` | none |
| Base of stack | if stacked | Branch that must merge first | none |
| Push authorization | yes | Human approval to push | required at Stage 7 |

## Preconditions

- `gh` is installed and authenticated. Verify with `gh auth status`.
- The repo is `trackdubllc/Trackdub` on branch `main`.
- `dotnet` SDK matches `global.json`.
- For stacked work, `gh stack` is available. Verify with `gh stack --help`.
- The change does not contain a hand-resolved `packages.lock.json` conflict.

## Execution Stages

### Stage 1 - Working Tree Audit

- **Goal**: Know exactly what will be committed before committing anything.
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/processes/pr-lifecycle.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. List branch, status, and diff. Use the GitKraken tools for workspace-aware git operations (`gitkraken_workspace_list`, `git_branch`, `git_log_or_diff`).
  2. Inventory every changed file by project. Flag changes that add a `ProjectReference` — those require an AGENTS.md diagram edit or Architecture tests will fail.
  3. Flag any `packages.lock.json` in the diff. Do not hand-merge it; take one side and run `dotnet restore Trackdub.slnx --force-evaluate -m:1`.
  4. Flag build output, secrets, absolute local paths, and machine-specific paths in the diff.
  5. Confirm the change compiles before any polish work.
- **Exit criteria**: Exact file list known; nothing unbuildable or unsafe staged for commit.
- **Failure handling**: Unresolved conflict or junk in the tree → resolve here, before spending validation time.

### Stage 2 - Dev-Loop Validation (fast)

- **Goal**: Catch cheap failures before the expensive gate.
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/standards/validation-gates.md`, `.opencode/context/standards/coding-standards.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. ```bash
     dotnet build Trackdub.slnx -m:1
     dotnet test Trackdub.slnx -m:1
     ```
  2. For a focused failure, narrow with `dotnet test tests/Trackdub.<Area>.Tests --no-restore -m:1` or `dotnet test tests/Trackdub.Application.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~<TestName>" -m:1`.
  3. Reject new `Path.Combine` occurrences in changed lines (`BannedSymbols.txt`). This is currently a warning, not an error — catch it here rather than letting it accumulate.
- **Exit criteria**: Debug build clean; full Debug test suite green.
- **Failure handling**: Red here means red later. Fix before advancing. Route deep diagnosis to `core-diagnostics`.

### Stage 3 - Full Release CI Gate

- **Goal**: Reproduce CI exactly. This is the gate that authorizes publishing.
- **Actor**: subagent `validation-gate`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/standards/validation-gates.md`, `.opencode/context/templates/evidence-report.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. ```bash
     dotnet restore Trackdub.slnx -m:1
     dotnet build Trackdub.slnx --configuration Release --no-restore -m:1 -warnaserror
     dotnet test Trackdub.slnx --configuration Release --no-build -m:1
     ```
  2. Confirm Architecture tests passed inside that run. They enforce Domain-has-no-references, Contracts-references-only-Domain, the AGENTS.md diagram match, `StageNames` consistency, and the no-base-branch-filter guard on `ci.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `model-audit.yml`, `benchmark-report-validation.yml`.
  3. Treat any warning under `-warnaserror` as a hard failure. Do not suppress to make it pass.
- **Exit criteria**: Release build with warnings-as-errors green; full Release test suite green.
- **Failure handling**: FAIL → `core-diagnostics`, fix, re-run this stage. **Stop condition: do not push a red PR to save time.** Only an explicit human instruction overrides this.

### Stage 4 - Architecture Bounds Audit

- **Goal**: Confirm the change respects layer direction.
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/domain/architecture.md`, `.opencode/context/standards/architecture-rules.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. Domain depends on nothing. No new reference out of `Trackdub.Domain`.
  2. No inference leaking upward into Application, Contracts, or Media.
  3. AGENTS.md diagram matches every `src/**.csproj` `ProjectReference` in both directions.
  4. Confirm with `dotnet test tests/Trackdub.Architecture.Tests --no-restore -m:1`.
- **Exit criteria**: No upward or sideways edge introduced.
- **Failure handling**: Violation → `core-diagnostics`; invert with an interface rather than adding a reference.

### Stage 5 - Cubic Review (read-only)

- **Goal**: Surface issues before a human reviewer spends attention.
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/processes/pr-lifecycle.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. After the PR exists (Stage 8), use the cubic MCP tools: `trigger_pr_review` once per review — it returns immediately without progress, so do not poll it — then `get_pr_issues` to read findings. An empty array means no open issues remain.
  2. Review is advisory at this point. Triage each finding as real-and-worth-fixing, not-real, or intended-behavior.
  3. Read-only: do not resolve threads before the fix exists.
- **Exit criteria**: Findings triaged with a decision per item.
- **Failure handling**: cubic CLI is not installed in this environment (verified: `cubic --version` → not found); the MCP server path is the working route. If neither is available, record the gap rather than claiming a clean review.

### Stage 6 - Commit

- **Goal**: Create a reviewable commit. **Always `git commit -m`.**
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/standards/coding-standards.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. Stage only intended paths. Use GitKraken `git_add` with explicit pathspecs, not `git add -A`.
  2. Imperative title: `Add ...`, `Fix ...`, `Remove ...`.
  3. **Always use `git commit -m "<message>"`. The interactive commit editor is broken in this environment — never open it.** Use GitKraken `git_commit` (`git commit -m <message> [files...]`).
  4. One logical change per commit. Split unrelated work.
- **Exit criteria**: Commit exists; working tree holds only intended changes.
- **Failure handling**: Accidental staging → unstage and restage explicitly.

### Stage 7 - Push

- **Goal**: Publish the branch.
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/processes/pr-lifecycle.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. Confirm Stage 3 was green immediately before this stage. If time has passed or the tree changed, re-run the gate.
  2. Push with the GitKraken `git_push` tool for workspace-aware behavior. Verify remote and branch first with `gitkraken_workspace_list` and `git_branch`.
  3. For stacked branches, confirm the base branch is pushed first; GitHub needs the base to exist to compute the diff.
- **Exit criteria**: Branch present on the remote at the expected commit.
- **Failure handling**: Push rejected ⇒ the base branch is missing or history diverged. Fix the base first; never force-push over a shared branch.

### Stage 8 - Open or Update the PR

- **Goal**: Give reviewers a coherent diff and the evidence.
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/processes/pr-lifecycle.md`, `.opencode/context/templates/evidence-report.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. Open or update with `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit`.
  2. Body states: what changed, why, the exact commands run with results, and what was deliberately not changed.
  3. Reference the Linear issue id. Do **not** change Linear status from this loop.
  4. Keep the PR scope to one logical change.
- **Exit criteria**: PR open against the correct base; body carries the gate evidence.
- **Failure handling**: Wrong base ⇒ recreate against the intended base.

### Stage 9 - CI Check Polling

- **Goal**: Know the real CI verdict from CI, not from assumption.
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/processes/pr-lifecycle.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. Watch with `gh pr checks <pr-number>` until all checks reach a terminal state.
  2. Relevant workflows: `ci.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `code-coverage.yml`, `model-audit.yml`, `release-shipping-guard.yml`, `opencode-review.yml`, `trt-rtx-smoke.yml`.
  3. Benchmarks are **not** part of this gate. BenchmarkDotNet does not run on pull-request CI by policy; real-model and saved-commit comparisons are opt-in via `benchmark-dotnet.yml`. Never wait on a benchmark check here.
  4. If `model-audit.yml` fails, the change touched model inventory or manifest integrity — route to `benchmark-regression-triage.md` scope or `core-diagnostics`.
- **Exit criteria**: All required checks terminal and green.
- **Failure handling**: Any red check → capture the exact failing log, fix, return to Stage 2. Do not merge around a red check.

### Stage 10 - Review Thread Triage and Fix Loop

- **Goal**: Resolve every open thread with a decision, not silence.
- **Actor**: `trackdub-orchestrator`; fixes by the relevant subagent
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/processes/pr-lifecycle.md`, `.opencode/context/standards/coding-standards.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. Read open threads (cubic `get_pr_issues`, plus `gh pr view --comments` for human review).
  2. Triage each: fix, or reply with the reason it is intended behavior. Never dismiss a thread to make the PR look clean.
  3. Cubic threads: `update_pr_issue_status` with `resolved` after the fix lands, or `false_positive` / `wont_fix` / `intended_behavior` with a comment when dismissing. Only `get_pr_issues` IDs are valid there — never a codebase-scan issue ID.
  4. For each fix round: re-run Stage 2, then Stage 3, then push and re-watch Stage 9.
  5. If a fix must land on the base before this PR, use `gh stack` to model the dependency. `WorkflowTriggerTests` guarantees `pull_request` triggers are not narrowed to a base branch, so stacked PRs do run CI.
- **Exit criteria**: Zero open threads; each resolved by fix or documented intent.
- **Failure handling**: Disagreement with a reviewer → escalate to human. Do not self-approve.

### Stage 11 - Merge

- **Goal**: Land the change with its evidence intact.
- **Actor**: human
- **Context to load**: `.opencode/context/processes/pr-lifecycle.md`
- **Actions**:
  1. Confirm: gate green, CI green, threads resolved, branch up to date with its base.
  2. Merge. Re-run Stage 3 locally if the base moved during review.
  3. Confirm the change landed on `main` and post-merge CI is green.
  4. **Linear is a manual human step.** The agent does not call the Linear API. Never mark an issue Done without proof — the proof is the green post-merge run, attached to the issue.
- **Exit criteria**: Change on `main`; post-merge CI green; Linear status decided by the human.
- **Failure handling**: Post-merge red ⇒ revert promptly and diagnose.

## Decision Points

| Condition | Decision |
|---|---|
| Stage 3 gate red | Stop. Do not push. Only an explicit human instruction overrides |
| Architecture bounds violated | Invert with an interface; do not add a reference |
| `packages.lock.json` conflicts | Take one side, then `dotnet restore Trackdub.slnx --force-evaluate -m:1` |
| Fix must precede the main change | Stack with `gh stack`; base PR first |
| Cubic finding is real | Fix in the same PR, re-run Stage 2 and 3 |
| Cubic finding is not real | Reply with reasoning; mark `false_positive` / `intended_behavior` |
| Checks pending after push | Wait. Never merge around a pending check |
| Only benchmarks are red | Out of scope for this gate — `benchmark-regression-triage.md` |
| Human wants Linear updated | Human does it, with attached proof |

## Gates

- **G1 — Fast gate** (end Stage 2): Debug build + full Debug tests green.
- **G2 — Release gate** (end Stage 3): `dotnet restore`, Release `-warnaserror` build, full Release tests. Authorizes publishing.
- **G3 — Bounds gate** (end Stage 4): Domain-has-no-references, Contracts-only-Domain, diagram match.
- **G4 — Remote gate** (end Stage 9): every required `gh pr checks` terminal and green.
- **G5 — Thread gate** (end Stage 10): zero open threads, each resolved by fix or documented intent.
- **Stop condition**: A failed gate halts the loop. Do not push a red PR to save time unless the human explicitly instructs it.

## Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Commit opens an editor and hangs | Interactive editor invoked | Use `git commit -m`; the editor is broken here |
| Push rejected, remote ref missing | Base branch not pushed | Push the base first |
| `-warnaserror` fails on a new warning | New warning introduced, or suppressed | Fix the warning; do not suppress |
| `Packages.lock.json` merge conflict | Hand-resolved conflict | `git checkout --ours/--theirs`, then `--force-evaluate` |
| Architecture test: csproj not in diagram | New `ProjectReference` | Update the AGENTS.md diagram |
| Architecture test: diagram lists missing project | Stale diagram entry | Remove it; test checks both directions |
| Stacked PR never runs CI | Someone added a `branches:` filter | `WorkflowTriggerTests` blocks this; re-run Architecture tests |
| Cubic review never returns | `trigger_pr_review` does not report progress | Do not poll; read with `get_pr_issues` later |
| Model-audit check red | Model manifest or inventory changed | `core-diagnostics`; verify manifest and license metadata |
| Post-merge CI red | Base moved or merge artifact | Revert promptly, diagnose on the reverted state |
| `/ready` disagrees with local green | Non-deterministic or hardware-dependent test | Capture both results; treat divergence as a real finding |
