# Why this system exists

## Purpose

`AGENTS.md` at the repo root already carries the rules: dependency direction, build commands, banned APIs, model governance, conflict order. It is dense, and it is read as prose. This `.opencode` system exists to turn those rules into **routable, executable procedure** — so an agent lands on the right context, runs the right command in the right order, and reports what actually happened.

Three problems it solves:

1. **Rules that are not actions.** "Treat warnings as errors" is a rule. `dotnet build Trackdub.slnx --configuration Release --no-restore -m:1 -warnaserror` is the gate. This system wires the second to the first.
2. **The readiness lie.** AGENTS.md principle 3: *provider registered ≠ model downloaded ≠ stage ran ≠ stage succeeded*. Language models compress that into a plausible sentence. `/ready` makes the compression impossible by forcing a rung-by-rung verdict with evidence.
3. **Context cost.** Every rule in `AGENTS.md`, every architecture invariant, every process, and every report shape in the orchestrator's context on every turn. Most turns need a small fraction. This system moves the rest behind an allocation decision.

## Scope: core repo only

This system governs **`trackdubllc/Trackdub`** — the public core: `src/Trackdub.*`, `src/DubBench*`, `tests/Trackdub.Architecture.Tests`, `tools/`, `scripts/`, and `.github/workflows/`.

It does **not** govern the Avalonia desktop shell. That lives in the `Trackdub-gated` repo under `App.Avalonia` / `App.Avalonia.Tests` / `UI.Tests`, with its own `.opencode` system at `../Trackdub-gated/.opencode/`.

The split is not administrative convenience — see [Cross-repo split](#cross-repo-split) below.

## Three-level context allocation

The central mechanism. Context is loaded in one of three bands, decided before the task starts.

**Level 1 — isolation. Default. ~80% of tasks.**
Load nothing beyond what the task names. `/pin <sha>` in core loads one file. Fixing a stage-name constant loads the architecture tests and nothing else. Rationale: most requests are bounded, and a bounded request does not benefit from an unbounded context. Loading everything is not safer — it is noisier, and it dilutes the constraint that matters.

**Level 2 — filtered. Multi-file work.**
Load the **category index** (`domain/`, `processes/`, `standards/`, `templates/`), then only the specific files the task needs. Rationale: at this point the agent knows roughly which concern it is in but not which document holds the detail. The index resolves that in one read instead of a directory listing plus guessing.

**Level 3 — full. Cross-cutting analysis. Rare.**
Load everything. Justified only for work where a file you did not read would have changed your answer: dependency-graph edits, project renames or moves, model manifest or licensing changes, anything touching layering policy, TFM or packaging changes, and new projects entering `src/`. Rationale: at this scale, the failure mode is not "too little context" but "a rule you did not know existed." Under-reading a layering invariant costs a broken build and a reverted PR; the cost of over-reading is bounded token spend on a handful of tasks.

The level is chosen per task, not per session, and Level 3 is not a default escalated to by habit.

## Why four subagents, and what each owns

Subagents exist to **bound a concern**, not to add parallelism. Each is a single-writer owner of one kind of work, so the orchestrator never has to hold two competing mental models of the same subsystem.

| Agent | Edit | Concern | Why it is separate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pipeline-inference` | **allow** | Producing change: pipeline stages, stage handlers, runtime stages, execution providers, engines, model manifest entries, through `Contracts → Domain → Application → Composition`. Also the sole writer for `/pin`. | Keeps mutation authority unambiguous. Exactly one agent can write; every judgement-bearing agent cannot. |
| `validation-gate` | deny | CI-equivalence and the architecture bounds audit; owns PASS/FAIL | **Separation of duties.** The agent that produced a change must not certify it. `pipeline-inference` cannot pass its own work; `validation-gate` has no write authority to make its verdict true. |
| `core-diagnostics` | deny | Read-only triage: build/test failures, `packages.lock.json` conflicts, pin fallout, warnings-as-errors breaks, native ONNX/CUDA/TensorRT loading, flaky tests. Backs `/ready`. | Enforces non-mutation structurally, not by instruction. A readiness audit that could "just fix it" is worthless — the fix would make the rung pass without proving it. |
| `benchmark-perf` | deny | Benchmark execution, baseline diffing, regression attribution | Measurement discipline. Restricting it to measure-and-report keeps tuning decisions — which are user decisions — out of the measurement path, so a number is never produced by the same loop that wanted a better one. |

The load-bearing property is not the count of four; it is that **three of four have `edit: deny`.** Read-only is enforced by permission, not by good intentions. A judge that could edit its own evidence is not a judge.

`validation-gate` is the one that prevents the worst collapse — "I built it and it works" as a single unverifiable claim.

Note the consequence for `/pin`: it mutates git state, so it cannot run on a judge. It routes to the writer and carries an explicit mid-procedure recovery instruction, because a read-only agent failing *between* the submodule checkout and the commit would leave the gated repo dirty.

## Why the orchestrator keeps governance and release/ops docs

Architecture governance, ADRs, layering policy, release notes, and CI policy are **not** delegated. Two reasons.

**Continuity.** These are the decisions that constrain every subagent. If they live in a subagent, the orchestrator holds a summary of them forever and the summary drifts from the source. Keeping them in the orchestrator means the governing context is always the same context that dispatches the work.

**Authority.** Dependency direction, conflict order, and model-licensing rules are decisions about the system, not tasks within it. A delegation boundary implies the delegate decides within it. Architecture policy is decided once, globally, and then applied — it is not delegated scope. The subagents consume governance; they do not author it.

Practically: the orchestrator reads fewer files than any other agent, and holds the most authority.

## Manager–worker, and keeping context out of the window

This is a manager–worker pattern. The orchestrator decomposes, delegates, adjudicates between results, and reports. It does not hold subagent transcripts, read the files a subagent read, or retain intermediate reasoning from work it delegated.

Why it matters concretely: a `/validate` run touches a Release build and a full test pass across the solution. The failure output, the restore log, and the per-project warnings belong to `validation-gate`'s context. They do not belong in the orchestrator's — not because tokens are precious in the abstract, but because the orchestrator's context has one job: hold the system-level constraints accurately while dispatching the next task. Every line of delegated output is a line not spent on that.

The rule is mechanical: work delegated is context not retained. If a subagent's result needs to persist, it persists as the verdict and the evidence — not as the transcript that produced it.

## Evidence and gating

**No claim without a command that proves it.**

This is not aspirational; it is the load-bearing assumption of the whole system. AGENTS.md: "never mark Done without proof." A proof is a command, an exit code, an artifact, or a file path — not a recollection, not a doc that says so, not a green badge from a previous run.

Therefore:

- **`NOT VERIFIED` is a valid and expected output**, not a failure to be papered over. It is the honest state when a rung has no evidence behind it. Every rung of `/ready`, every gate of `/validate`, every delta of `/bench` accepts it.
- **Partial evidence never becomes a pass.** `/validate` stops at the first failing gate and shows the exact command and output. `/bench` reports measured numbers only — a missing baseline means `NOT VERIFIED`, never "no regression". `/ready` never rounds a rung up.
- **Rules are enforced by the build wherever possible.** `BannedSymbols.txt` via `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BannedApiAnalyzers`; dependency direction, acyclicity, ADR-0011 Contracts isolation, ONNX/WinML/DNNL asset invariants and portable-RID lock graphs via `tests/Trackdub.Architecture.Tests`; analyzer diagnostics via `src/Trackdub.Analyzers`. A rule that can be a test should be a test — a test fails deterministically, and an instruction does not.
- **Documentation is not evidence.** For implementation facts, `trackdub-docs-rag` MCP (spec `tools/docs-rag/SPEC.md`) grounds answers, Context7 covers third-party libraries, and both are treated as evidence to be verified against live code. The conflict order still governs: source/tests > task instructions > Linear > documentation.

## Stateless design

**State lives in the repo: code, tests, git history, and the PR. Nothing lives in bookkeeping files.**

The system holds no task database, no progress ledger, no status file, no notes-to-self. Consequences:

- A fresh session with no prior context reaches the same conclusion an interrupted one would, because every fact needed to reconstruct state is in the tree.
- There is no reconciliation problem. No bookkeeping file can drift from reality, because there is no bookkeeping file.
- There is no serialization point, and therefore no lost-update class of bug.

The same reasoning explains `NOT VERIFIED` being load-bearing rather than a hedge: the system's only durable record is the evidence in the repo, so an unproven claim has nowhere to hide.

## Cross-repo split

Two repos, two `.opencode` systems, one seam.

`Trackdub` is the public core and is consumed as a **pinned read-only submodule** (`external/Trackdub`) by `Trackdub-gated`, which owns the Avalonia desktop shell. The split follows the deployment boundary, which is also a governance boundary: core can be consumed by anything, gated is application-specific.

One consequence is architectural and worth stating plainly — **the gated repo builds against the pin, never against core `HEAD`.** Editing inside `external/Trackdub` is forbidden; `/pin` reports any such edit as a hard failure. If a bump needs a core change, that change lands in the core repo, in its own PR, and is pinned afterward.

This is why `/pin` exists in **both** systems, and why this copy handles being invoked from the wrong repo: from core it explains that the submodule lives in gated and redirects to `../Trackdub-gated/.opencode/context/processes/submodule-pin-bump.md`. One procedure, documented once, reachable from both sides.

The cost is duplication at the boundary: core and gated each describe the pin procedure. Accepted — the alternative is a shared file that neither repo owns, which the stateless rule already rules out.

## Known gaps

- **Linear is referenced but not integrated.** `AGENTS.md` names workspace `trackdubllc`, team **TS**, `repo:core`, requires autonomous tracking, and forbids marking Done without proof. No Linear MCP server or tool is wired into this system. Reading and updating Linear issues stays a **manual human step**. This is the largest gap: the "never mark Done without proof" rule is currently enforced socially, not mechanically.
- **The desktop repo has its own system.** Core and gated are separate trees with separate context. Cross-cutting reasoning that spans both — anything touching the core/desktop contract — must load two systems. `/pin` and the breaking-change triage are the mitigation, not a solution.
- **Two planned workflows are unwritten.** `feature-change` and `release-and-pin` are named in the routing table but do not exist. The three shipped workflows are `new-inference-stage`, `pr-ready-loop`, and `benchmark-regression-triage`.
- **Factual claims decay.** Every grounding statement in `context/` was verified at authoring time against a specific revision. Counts, file paths, test names, and type names drift. Anything asserted here should be re-verified with `verify with: <command>` before being relied on, and this tree will otherwise start lying to its own agents.
