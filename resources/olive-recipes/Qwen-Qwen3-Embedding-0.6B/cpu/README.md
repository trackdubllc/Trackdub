# Qwen-Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B — CPU optimization

This folder contains Olive recipes for optimizing Qwen-Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B targeting the CPU EP.

## What this folder is for

- Execution Provider: CPU EP
- Typical precision: INT4
- Recipe: `Qwen-Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B_cpu_int4.json` (build only), `Qwen-Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B_cpu_int4_with_eval.json` (build + evaluate)

## Setup

1) Install the main branch of Olive:
   - pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/olive.git
2) Install the requirements for this recipe:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Build the model

```bash
olive run --config Qwen-Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B_cpu_int4.json
```

After building, copy `config_sentence_transformers.json` into the model output directory. This file provides task-specific query prompts required by MTEB retrieval benchmarks (e.g., NFCorpus). ModelBuilder does not include it in its output, so it must be copied manually from the Hugging Face cache:

```bash
cp ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--Qwen--Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B/snapshots/*/config_sentence_transformers.json model_cpu_int4/
```

Also set `tie_word_embeddings` to `true` in the output `config.json`. Olive currently writes this as `false` even though the model uses tied embeddings (see [Olive#2424](https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/issues/2424)):

```bash
python3 -c "import json; f='model_cpu_int4/config.json'; d=json.load(open(f)); d['tie_word_embeddings']=True; json.dump(d,open(f,'w'),indent=2)"
```

## Build and evaluate with MTEB

To build the model and run the [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) STS17 benchmark comparing the source HuggingFace model against the exported ONNX/GenAI model:

```bash
olive run --config Qwen-Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B_cpu_int4_with_eval.json
```

> **Note:** Ensure `config_sentence_transformers.json` is present in the model output directory before running evaluation (see copy step above). Without it, retrieval benchmarks like NFCorpus will show ~20% lower scores.

The evaluation results will be logged at the end of the run, showing scores for both the source (HF) and exported (GenAI) models. The MTEB score of the exported ONNX model should be within 5% of the base PyTorch model.

## Evaluation results (A100)

_Pending re-evaluation with prompt fix._

## Additional notes

- Pipeline: SelectiveMixedPrecision → GPTQ → RTN → ModelBuilder → GraphSurgeries (INT4 with include_hidden_states)
- This is an embedding model — outputs hidden states for embedding generation.
- Runs purely on CPU; no GPU required.
