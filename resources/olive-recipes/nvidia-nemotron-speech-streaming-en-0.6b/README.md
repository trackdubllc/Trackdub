# nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b

Olive recipes for [nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b),
a 0.6B-parameter streaming English ASR model.

## Performance

- **Accuracy:** average unweighted **WER of 8.20%** across the 8 standard ESB
  [Open ASR Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/open_asr_leaderboard)
  benchmarks.
- **Speed:** above **2 RTFx** running on **4 cores of an Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 165H**
  (INT4 CPU build produced by this recipe).

## Recipes

- [`cpu/`](./cpu) — ONNX export + INT4 quantization for CPU execution providers.

See the README inside each subfolder for setup and run instructions.

## Future Acceptance Guidelines

When evaluating new ASR models for inclusion, the following targets apply on
the 8 standard ESB / Open ASR Leaderboard benchmarks (average unweighted WER):

- **Batch models:** WER must be **< 8%**.
- **Streaming models:** *streaming WER* (computed by concatenating the per-utterance
  output tokens emitted during streaming inference) must be **< 9%**, measured with
  **sub-second algorithmic latency** (chunk size + lookahead < 1 s).

All WER numbers are computed with the **Open ASR Leaderboard normalizer**:
`EnglishTextNormalizer` for English benchmarks and `BasicMultilingualTextNormalizer`
for multilingual benchmarks (see
[huggingface/open_asr_leaderboard](https://github.com/huggingface/open_asr_leaderboard)
→ `normalizer/`). This matches Whisper's text-normalization scheme so numbers
are directly comparable to the public leaderboard.

A relaxation of **+1% WER** is acceptable if, on the same hardware under the
same compute budget (e.g. number of CPU cores, GPU, or NPU), the candidate
model achieves **at least 2× the RTFx** of the current best supported model in
its category:

- **Batch baseline:** the Whisper variant from
  [openai/whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai) whose total parameter count is
  closest to the candidate (within ±25%) — currently `whisper-tiny` (39M),
  `whisper-base` (74M), `whisper-small` (244M), `whisper-medium` (769M),
  `whisper-large-v3` (1.55B), or `whisper-large-v3-turbo` (809M).
- **Streaming baseline:** the model in this recipe,
  [`nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b),
  exported and quantized via the [`cpu/`](./cpu) recipe (INT4 ONNX, the same
  artifact whose numbers are reported above).

Both baselines must be benchmarked with the same audio inputs, the same
normalizer, and the same hardware/compute budget as the candidate.

We also prefer models with lower long-form WER. Required long-form thresholds:

- **Earnings21:** WER must be **< 15%**.
- **TED-LIUM (long-form):** WER must be **< 5%**.

We also prefer **quantized models that fit under 2 GB on disk** — and ideally
under **1 GB**. We acknowledge this may not always be achievable for very
strong models, in which case the accuracy/RTFx criteria above take precedence.

We also prefer **cross-platform models** that run on the majority of consumer
hardware (CPU, integrated GPU, NPU) rather than models that require a specific
accelerator or vendor-locked runtime.

**Multilingual models** will be evaluated against **FLEURS**, **Common Voice**,
**Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS)**, and **VoxPopuli**, on the subset of those
datasets where the target language is available. No hard WER thresholds are
set yet — targets depend on the per-language difficulty and data availability.
Concrete numbers will likely be added soon.

Future models we plan to compare against (not yet integrated, but in progress):

- **Cohere Transcribe** (batch)
- **Moonshine Streaming v2** (streaming)
