/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><strong>Lifecycle &amp; lease shape:</strong>
/// Callers obtain an exclusive <see cref="SessionLease"/> via <see cref="GetLeaseAsync"/>.
/// The lease holds the session until disposed; disposal releases the session back to the pool
/// without destroying it.  This allows warm sessions to survive across DI scope boundaries.</para>
///
/// <para><strong>Bounded capacity:</strong>
/// The pool holds at most <c>maxSessions</c> live sessions across all keys (default: 12).
/// This is a <em>count-based</em> cap that applies when memory admission is explicitly
/// disabled. Memory admission (on by default) adds a resident-memory budget per bucket:
/// before construct, reserve <see cref="SessionPoolKey.EstimatedVramMb"/>, evict idle
/// sessions to fit, and wait — never allocate an unbudgeted ephemeral session. CPU, DNNL,
/// and OpenVINO CPU-proxy sessions are accounted against the host RAM budget; OpenVINO NPU
/// sessions and other accelerators are accounted per device, so CPU work no longer
/// collides with GPU 0. When admission is explicitly
/// disabled and the count limit is reached with every entry leased, the new session is
/// created outside the pool (ephemeral) and disposed when its lease is released.</para>
///
/// <para><strong>Process-isolated VRAM observation:</strong>
/// When the host registers a process-GPU reader (see
/// <see cref="SharedPoolOptions.UseProcessGpuMemoryReader"/>), accelerator admission also floors
/// each device's admitted usage at this process's real dedicated GPU footprint, so GPU memory the
/// pool does not account for — driver contexts, runtime arenas, non-pooled consumers — consumes
/// the same per-device budget instead of being invisible to admission. Host-RAM buckets are
/// unaffected, an unavailable reading leaves reservation accounting exactly as it was, and
/// <c>TRACKDUB_SESSION_PROCESS_GPU_ADMISSION</c> disables the observation explicitly.</para>
///
/// <para><strong>Single-flight creation:</strong>
/// Concurrent misses for the same key share one factory invocation. Cancelling one waiter
/// does not cancel another caller’s valid acquisition.</para>
///
/// <para><strong>Model invalidation:</strong>
/// Session keys carry both the model file <em>path hash</em> and a cached content digest
/// (<see cref="SessionPoolKey.ModelContentHash"/>): helper-built keys invalidate when a
/// model file is replaced at the same path, while direct-constructed keys that omit the
/// content hash keep path-only identity.</para>
///
/// <para><strong>Memory pressure guidance:</strong>
/// Each ONNX session can consume hundreds of MB of accelerator or host memory depending on
/// model size. Admission enforces realistic budgets; call <see cref="EvictModelAsync"/> to
/// free memory for a model that is no longer needed, or <see cref="Dispose"/> to release
/// the entire pool. The default host limit can reject large graphs and graph bundles; see
/// <c>docs/reference/session-pool-memory-admission.md</c> for sizing and the explicit override.</para>
///
/// <para><strong>Thread safety:</strong>
/// All public APIs are thread-safe.  Sessions are single-threaded: only one caller may hold
/// a lease for a given key at a time, serialised by an internal per-entry gate.</para>
