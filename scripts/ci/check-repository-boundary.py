"""Scan the public-core legal/policy surface for stale monorepo-era claims.

Guards against regressions like the GPLv3/dual-license CLA wording and the
false "Implemented in Application layer" IExportTierGate claim found during
the open-core split: license text that contradicts the Apache-2.0 LICENSE,
and desktop/cloud project names bleeding into files a public consumer of
this core would read as authoritative.

This intentionally does not scan docs/architecture, docs/specs,
docs/operations, docs/development, docs/decisions, docs/audits, docs/plans,
or tools/**: those contain legitimate historical/internal-engineering
references to pre-split monorepo projects (Trackdub.App.Avalonia,
Trackdub.Api, Trackdub.Worker, Trackdub.WebhookDelivery, the activation
service) that are a separate, larger documentation cleanup — not part of
this check.
