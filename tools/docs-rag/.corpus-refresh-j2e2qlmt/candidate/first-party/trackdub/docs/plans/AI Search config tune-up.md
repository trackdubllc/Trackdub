# AI Search config tune-up: execution status

Tracked record for the supplied plan from
`Trackdub-gated/external/Trackdub/docs/plans/AI Search config tune-up.md`.
The pinned submodule is unchanged. Known deficiencies remain explicit rather
than being represented as passing acceptance checks.

## Original published implementation

| Plan step | Implementation and evidence |
|---|---|
| Messages-format ask | One scoped REST chat-completions call supplies answer and citations; query rewriting enabled; limit nested under retrieval. |
| First-party metadata | Remote-binding uploader preserves bytes and attaches metadata only to first-party objects. All 197 source objects checked: 126 flags, 71 vendors without flags. |
| Automatic indexing | All uploads must succeed before requesting an indexing job. Ambiguous timeouts require inspecting existing jobs before retrying. |
| Instance settings | 86400-second sync, trigram tokenizer, boolean `is_first_party` schema and existence boost. |
| Empty-search fallback | AND then one OR request only after successful empty retrieval; same scope and limit. Errors propagate. |
| Publish | Core `a3e3f18`, `c751d4a`, plan record `c747acf`; API `59037f8`, on respective `agent/rag-tuneup` branches. No merge or PR. |
| Deploy | Worker version `27a4fccc-6c5d-4d0a-8fc7-e64206653515` still serves API `59037f8`, not the follow-up below. |

## Follow-up implemented and verified

Follow-up code and documentation are local, uncommitted and unpushed in the core
and API task worktrees. No follow-up Worker deployment has occurred.

- **Complete staging gate:** separate candidate snapshot; missing/empty repos
  or failed/empty vendor fetches abort before upload/reindex. Previous staging
  survives; `.staging.previous` retains the backup if promotion and rollback
  both fail. Intentional repo-only staging and existing size limits remain.
- **Read-only verifier:** `tools/docs-rag/verify_index.mjs` compares complete
  source/index inventories, unique keys, metadata flags and scope folders,
  status/errors, pending actions, chunks, sizes and last-seen timestamps. It
  refuses active/changing jobs, detects source changes and requires an uncached
  symbol content canary after inventory passes. It never requests a job.
- **Partial identifiers:** after empty AND and OR, code-like identifiers get at
  most 20 same-scope hybrid candidates without cache/reranking for that request.
  Only literal identifier-prefix matches within returned text survive; requested
  output limit is enforced. `matchMode: "symbol-fallback"` identifies this path.
  Global models/thresholds are unchanged; this is not exhaustive substring search.
- **Metadata repair:** temporary boolean schema field triggered a full rebuild;
  removing it triggered a second rebuild, ending 2026-09-22 at 04:05:51 UTC.
  Post-cleanup verification found all 126 indexed boolean flags, no vendor flags,
  and correct folders for all 197 keys. Source bytes were unchanged by repair.

## Evidence

- Core: 15 Python tests and 32 Node tests pass, including failed-refresh rollback,
  real R2 terminal-page pagination shape, and missing/wrong scope-folder cases.
- API: typecheck and 87 RAG tests pass. Local modified `searchDocs` against live
  Cloudflare returned three literal `RegisterExec` hits in `all`, and the EP ABI
  reference alone for `first-party`, limit 1. Both used `symbol-fallback`.
- Exact two-symbol query still returns exactly three first-party hits with `and`,
  led by the EP ABI reference and ADR-0002.
- Post-cleanup live verifier: 197 source objects, 197 unique indexed items, 126
  first-party flags, **25 outdated capacity-error items**. Exit 1 correctly
  reports incomplete index readiness; no other inventory issues were reported.
- Full API run: 136 main-suite tests plus 20 activation tests passed, but two
  baseline Better Auth unhandled rejections remain. Existing suppression permits
  exit 0; this is not a clean full-suite result.

## Remaining limits

- [ ] **Index readiness:** resolve 25 `workers_ai_out_of_capacity_error` items,
  then require a clean full verifier run including its content canary. Do not
  use the earlier 197-completed observation from before rebuilding as current.
- **First-party preference:** uncached `runtime cache` still ranks an NVIDIA
  result first and Trackdub second after metadata recovery. Existence boost
  biases candidates before reranking; it is not a hard ordering guarantee.
- **First-message rewriting:** Cloudflare uses the first user message as-is.
  Stateless ask supplies no history and demonstrates no rewrite benefit.
  `searchQuery: null` truthfully reports omitted upstream `search_query`.
- **Verification boundaries:** same-size content freshness is not proven for
  every chunk, and the content canary covers one document. Cached staging from
  older script versions is not retroactively certified. Remote uploads are not
  transactional; already uploaded objects remain changed after partial failure.
- **Operational follow-up:** Linear access was unavailable; no issue was marked
  Done. When access is available, search team `TS` for a matching issue and update
  it, or create one if none exists; apply `repo:*`, `area:*`, and `agent-owned`
  labels, and keep the issue In Progress while the remaining acceptance work is
  active. No cloud security scan or cloud code review was performed.
