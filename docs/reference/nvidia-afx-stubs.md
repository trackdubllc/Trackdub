# NVIDIA AFX readiness contract

Trackdub integrates **NVIDIA Audio Effects (AFX / Maxine)** as an optional speech-enhancement backend. DeepFilterNet3 remains the default and the fallback. Layout, native behavior and verification are in [nvidia-afx-wiring.md](nvidia-afx-wiring.md).

The file keeps its original name for existing links; the integration is no longer a stub.

## Honesty contract

| Signal | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `INvidiaAfxRuntimeReadinessService` | `NvidiaAfxRuntimeReadinessService` (probe-based). Ready only when the license is accepted, the native library, any feature DLLs the layout requires and every model the profile needs are present, **and** an effect creates, loads and runs a frame at every supported rate on this machine. Only successful native probes are cached; file checks run on every call. |
| `NvidiaAfxIntegration.IsStubbed()` | Kill switch, `false`. While `true`, readiness never reports Ready, the installer and downloader refuse, and enhancement falls through to DeepFilterNet. |
| `NvidiaAfxSpeechAudioEnhancementService` | Falls through to DeepFilterNet when disabled, not ready, missing an AEC far-end reference, when the readiness check throws, or when the native run fails. |
| `NvidiaAfxRuntimeDownloader` / `NvidiaAfxRuntimeInstaller` | Still refuse placeholder packages, missing license acceptance and missing manifests. No hosted redistributable exists, so Trackdub does not download AFX; users point it at a local SDK. |
| `nvidiaafx-runtime.manifest.json` | Placeholder `example.invalid` URLs and zero hashes. Readiness uses it only as an architecture whitelist; the installer reads it to gate downloads and pick the architecture-matched package. It is never downloadable (`NvidiaAfxRuntimePackageGates`). |

Never treat component registration, settings fields or profile catalog entries as proof that AFX ran. The stage result's `Backend` is `NvidiaAfx` only when the native effect actually produced the audio.

## Open items

- No Trackdub-hosted redistributable: NVIDIA's license decides whether one can ship. Until then the runtime is user-installed.
- AEC needs a far-end reference that dubbing never has, so it is hidden from the UI and untested live.
- Speaker Focus (Early Access) is in the catalog but gated: it is hidden from `SelectableDefinitions` and readiness refuses it ("Early Access disabled") unless `TRACKDUB_AFX_ALLOW_EARLY_ACCESS=1` is set, because it ships under NVIDIA's evaluation license.
- Live proofs need a Windows NVIDIA RTX machine and never run in default CI.
