## FFmpeg / ffprobe binaries

- name: FFmpeg / ffprobe Windows x64 binaries (GyanD `codexffmpeg`, `essentials_build`)
- version / revision: FFmpeg 8.1.2, asset `ffmpeg-8.1.2-essentials_build.zip`
- source URL: https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases
- license: GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3) — confirmed directly against the shipped `LICENSE` file and `ffmpeg -version`'s own `--enable-gpl --enable-version3` build configuration, not assumed from the filename
- commercial use allowed? yes
- redistribution allowed? yes, provided the corresponding-source obligation is met when the binary is conveyed — see notes; Trackdub itself does not convey this binary
- attribution required? yes
- notes: Used only for the automatic FFmpeg bootstrap path (`FfmpegAutoDownloader`). The downloader fetches this at runtime on the end user's own machine; Trackdub does not bundle, ship, or otherwise convey the binary itself, so the GPLv3 source-conveyance obligation stays with GyanD as the actual distributor, not with Trackdub. Pinned to the exact asset URL and a locally-computed SHA-256 (GyanD does not publish its own checksums). GyanD (gyan.dev) is an immutable-per-version distributor — this specific `8.1.2` release will not be silently replaced under the same URL, unlike a rolling/"latest" tag. Chosen specifically because this build variant includes `libx264` (verified: extracted the binary, ran `-encoders`), which the software H.264 encoder fallback in `Trackdub.Media` depends on.

- name: FFmpeg / ffprobe Windows arm64, Linux x64, and Linux arm64 binaries (BtbN FFmpeg-Builds, `gpl-shared`)
- version / revision: BtbN's literal `latest` tag (their continuously-republished current-pointer release, distinct from their dated `autobuild-*` tags), assets `ffmpeg-master-latest-winarm64-gpl-shared.zip`, `ffmpeg-master-latest-linux64-gpl-shared.tar.xz`, `ffmpeg-master-latest-linuxarm64-gpl-shared.tar.xz`
- source URL: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
- license: GPLv3 for the selected `gpl-shared` build variant (BtbN does not publish a `-buildconf` per asset ahead of download the way this notice would ideally cite; treat as GPLv3 pending a build-time `-buildconf` capture, consistent with the Windows x64 entry above)
- commercial use allowed? yes
- redistribution allowed? yes, same corresponding-source reasoning as the Windows x64 entry — Trackdub does not convey this binary, it is fetched by the end user's own machine
- attribution required? yes
- notes: GyanD (used for Windows x64 above) does not publish arm64 or Linux builds, so these three RIDs use BtbN's `gpl-shared` variant of the rolling `latest` tag instead. Because `latest` is a moving target with no fixed content, `FfmpegAutoDownloader` does not pin a SHA-256 for these three packages (`Sha256` is `null`, a deliberate, typed "unverifiable, tracks upstream" state — see the doc comment on `FfmpegDownloadPackage`) — this is a real integrity-verification gap relative to the Windows x64 entry, accepted specifically because BtbN's dated tags were found to be unreliably retained (see the PR that introduced this notice, and issue #23) and GyanD does not cover these platforms.

## Lucene.NET analyzer package family

- name: Lucene.NET analyzer package family (`Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common`, `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Kuromoji`, `Lucene.Net.Analysis.SmartCn`, plus transitive Lucene.NET packages)
- version / revision: 4.8.0-beta00017
- source URL: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common/4.8.0-beta00017
- license: Apache-2.0
- commercial use allowed? yes
- redistribution allowed? yes, provided Apache-2.0 license notice is retained
- attribution required? yes
- notes: Managed NuGet analyzers used for project glossary matching in Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese. Lockfiles pin the Lucene.NET/ICU4N transitive closure used by this beta package family, and composition tests instantiate/tokenize through the registered analyzers as a runtime-load smoke test. Korean glossary matching remains on Trackdub's managed fallback scanner; no native dictionaries, Java runtime, Python runtime, or sidecar tokenizer is added in this slice.

## LibVLCSharp (.NET bindings for LibVLC)

- name: LibVLCSharp
- version / revision: centrally pinned in Directory.Packages.props
- source URL: https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp
- license: LGPL-2.1-or-later
- commercial use allowed? yes
- redistribution allowed? yes, provided LGPL-2.1 obligations are met (dynamic linking, no source modifications)
- attribution required? yes
- notes: .NET bindings for the LibVLC media framework. Trackdub links to LibVLC dynamically (LGPL compliance). No modifications are made to the LibVLC or LibVLCSharp source. Used in `Trackdub.Media.Playback` as one of two composited playback backends (libmpv is the primary compositor; LibVLC is the fallback). Bundling the native LibVLC runtime and any Avalonia-specific video-rendering control is a packaging concern of the consuming desktop product, not the public core, and is documented in that product's own third-party notices.

## LibVLC on Linux (system-installed)

- name: LibVLC (system package)
- version / revision: system-provided (distro package manager)
- source URL: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
- license: LGPL-2.1-or-later
- commercial use allowed? yes
- redistribution allowed? n/a — not bundled; users install via their system package manager
- attribution required? yes (license notice in documentation)
- notes: On Linux, no NuGet runtime package is available. `Trackdub.Media.Playback`'s `LibVlcRuntimeLocator` falls back to the system-installed `libvlc.so`. End users must install VLC (e.g., `sudo apt install vlc` or equivalent) for the LibVLC playback backend to function.

## Trackdub.OnnxRuntime.Dnnl.Native (generated package)

- name: ONNX Runtime with oneDNN/DNNL execution provider
- version / revision: matches the managed `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` package version used by Trackdub; package skeleton currently targets 1.24.4
- source URL: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime
- license: MIT for ONNX Runtime; oneDNN dependency is Apache-2.0
- commercial use allowed? yes
- redistribution allowed? yes, provided upstream license notices are retained
- attribution required? yes
- notes: Trackdub-owned native runtime flavor for manifest token `onnxruntime-dnnl`. Binaries are built by `tools/onnxruntime-dnnl/Build-OnnxRuntimeDnnlNativePackage.ps1` and packaged under `src/Trackdub.OnnxRuntime.Dnnl.Native/runtimes/<rid>/native/`; no placeholder binaries are checked in.

## Windows ML .NET APIs
