# Four-Dimension Resource Telemetry & Benchmark Pipeline Audit

Date: 2026-10-05
Scope: Resource telemetry collection, stage validation, bounds checking, and benchmark evidence integration across Trackdub.

---

### 1. SPEC: 9.0 / 10

**Evaluation**:
1. Telemetry capture and `BenchmarkEvidenceReport` structures are established and verified.
2. Resource telemetry (CPU, working set/memory, GPU/VRAM headroom) is validated against configured bounds across pipeline stages.
3. Layering conforms to architectural boundaries: contracts in Domain/Contracts, implementation in Application/Infrastructure, wiring in Composition.
4. Test suites cover: within bounds (`Passed`), missing telemetry / unsupported platforms (`Unavailable`/`Skipped`), and threshold exceedances (`Failed`).
5. Controlled-matrix runs forward resource bounds and emit structured validation evidence.
6. Solution builds and tests pass cleanly under `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`.

**Identified Gaps**:
1. **GPU Allocation Attribution vs Adapter Free Floor** ([IAvailableVramReader.cs](Trackdub/src/Trackdub.Contracts/Benchmarking/IAvailableVramReader.cs)): GPU telemetry measures adapter-wide available headroom (`availableVramMb` minimum floor via DXGI `QueryVideoMemoryInfo`) to detect memory pressure rather than process-isolated dedicated VRAM allocations.
   - **Resolved 2026-10-05.** Added `IProcessGpuMemoryReader` plus the `gpuBytes` evidence metric: on Windows `WindowsProcessGpuMemoryReader` sums this process's `Dedicated Usage` across its `GPU Process Memory` counter instances, giving a process-isolated attribution that `availableVramMb` deliberately does not. `--max-gpu-bytes` bounds it (the option was previously recognized but unhandled), and an unmeasurable reading with no configured budget is recorded as `Skipped` rather than downgrading a CPU-only stage. See [benchmark-evidence.md](Trackdub/docs/development/benchmark-evidence.md). **Follow-up resolved 2026-10-05.** The reading no longer only feeds telemetry: `SharedPoolOptions.UseProcessGpuMemoryReader` installs it as the shared pool's admission observation, and every accelerator admission decision floors that device's admitted usage at the process's real dedicated footprint (minus the reservations sibling devices already explain), so GPU memory the pool never reserved consumes the same per-device budget. Host-RAM buckets are unaffected, an unavailable reading leaves reservation accounting unchanged, and `TRACKDUB_SESSION_PROCESS_GPU_ADMISSION` is the explicit opt-out. See [session-pool-memory-admission.md](../reference/session-pool-memory-admission.md).
2. **Pre-flight Sanitization for Physically Impossible Bounds** ([ResourceTelemetryOptionsParser.cs](Trackdub/src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/ResourceTelemetryOptionsParser.cs)): CLI option parsing checks ranges and non-negativity, but accepts `--min-available-vram-mb` values exceeding physical adapter capacity without an upfront pre-flight warning before execution.
   - **Resolved 2026-10-05.** `ResourceBoundsPreflight` (core `src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/ResourceBoundsPreflight.cs`) compares the floor against the host's real adapter capacity — the largest adapter's dedicated plus shared video memory, read from the host's `IDeviceEnumerator` — and `ControlledDubbingBenchmarkRunner` fails the run during host setup, before any iteration is measured, with the option, the requested floor, and the capacity in the reason. An unknown capacity (no GPU adapter, an enumeration failure) skips the check instead of guessing, and vacuous maxima stay accepted because every reading satisfies them. **Follow-up 2026-10-05.** The `controlled` and `controlled-matrix` CLIs also print a host-capacity banner — detected devices with their memory, the video memory detected across GPU adapters, and the effective capacity — plus the configured floor's feasibility before the first iteration, using the same enumeration as the pre-flight so the two cannot disagree. See [benchmark-evidence.md](Trackdub/docs/development/benchmark-evidence.md).

### 2. DESIGN: 8.5 / 10

**Evaluation**:
- **Domain** (`src/Trackdub.Domain/Benchmarking/`): Zero external dependencies, pure immutable records (`ResourceTelemetryBounds`, `ResourceTelemetryCheck`, `ResourceTelemetryStatus`, `ResourceTelemetryValidation`, `ResourceUsageSnapshot`).
- **Contracts** (`src/Trackdub.Contracts/Benchmarking/`): Interfaces (`IResourceTelemetryValidator`, `IResourceTelemetryCollector`, `IAvailableVramReader`, `IWorkingSetSampler`) decouple callers from host diagnostics.
- **Application** (`src/Trackdub.Application/Benchmarking/`): `ResourceTelemetryValidator` encapsulates normalized CPU percentage, endpoint/sampled peak working set, and allocation delta verification.
- **Infrastructure** (`src/Trackdub.Infrastructure/`): Concrete process and OS queries isolated in `ProcessResourceTelemetryCollector`, `ProcessWorkingSetSampler`, and `WindowsAvailableVramReader`.
- **Composition** (`src/Trackdub.Composition/`): Headless composition root registers defaults via `TryAddSingleton`.

**Identified Gaps**:
1. **Direct Component Instantiation in Progress Collector** ([StageResourceTelemetryCapture.cs](Trackdub/src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/StageResourceTelemetryCapture.cs)): Progress capture instantiates `WorkingSetPeakMonitor` directly rather than through an injected monitor factory.
   - **Resolved 2026-10-06.** `WorkingSetPeakMonitorFactory` (core `src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/WorkingSetPeakMonitorFactory.cs`) is now the dedicated coordinator for peak-monitor lifetime: `StageResourceTelemetryCapture` creates its per-stage monitors through an injected `IWorkingSetPeakMonitorFactory` (defaulting to the production factory, so the public constructor is unchanged), and `ControlledDubbingBenchmarkRunner` plus `SeparationEvalRunner` create theirs through the same factory instead of `new`. Stage-boundary `Stop()` ownership is unchanged; only creation moved.
2. **Duplicated Option Extraction Branches** ([Program.cs](Trackdub/src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/Program.cs) and [ControlledStageBenchmarkMatrixOptionsParser.cs](Trackdub/src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/ControlledStageBenchmarkMatrixOptionsParser.cs)): CLI option parsing branches unpack bounds options separately in both entry points.
   - **Resolved 2026-10-06.** `ControlledBenchmarkCliBinder` (core `src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/ControlledBenchmarkCliBinder.cs`) is the single binder for the shared `controlled`/`controlled-matrix` surface: flags, value reads, `--runs`, shared string options, and resource bounds unpack in one place, with leaf validation still in `ResourceTelemetryOptionsParser`. Each command keeps only its divergent arms (`--stage` vs `--stages`, `--model` shapes, `--report-dir`). Error text and defaults are unchanged.

### 3. CORRECTNESS: 9.0 / 10

**Evaluation**:
- CLI command dispatch verified (`Trackdub.Benchmarks.DevHost controlled-matrix --help`).
- Full solution build passes in both Debug and Release configurations with zero warnings (`TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`).
- Test suites verified:
  - `Trackdub.Benchmarks.Tests`: 517 passed.
  - `Trackdub.Application.Tests`: 1,108 passed.
  - `Trackdub.Composition.Tests`: 275 passed.
  - `Trackdub.Domain.Tests`: 135 passed.
  - `Trackdub.Inference.Onnx.Tests`: 246 passed.
  - `Trackdub.Infrastructure.Tests`: 356 passed.
  - `Trackdub.Sdk.Tests`: 520 passed.

**Identified Gaps**:
1. **Interval Timer Precision Under CPU Load** ([WorkingSetPeakMonitor.cs](Trackdub/src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/WorkingSetPeakMonitor.cs)): The 25 ms `PeriodicTimer` cadence can experience thread-pool scheduling jitter during sustained multi-core benchmark saturation.
   - **Resolved 2026-10-06.** The monitor now measures inter-tick gaps and exposes a `SamplingWarning` when the longest gap exceeds 4x cadence (a single 2x blip is ordinary jitter; 4x means several sample windows were skipped). The warning is advisory only — peak results and stage execution are unchanged — and reaches the evidence three ways: the stage `workingSetBytes` check carries it as its `Reason` when the check passes (failure reasons still dominate), the run-level `workingSetPeakSampling` configuration appends it, and each `SeparationEvalResult` carries it (`peak_working_set_sampling_warning` in results JSONL). The threshold rule lives in the pure `DescribeDilationWarning` helper, covered deterministically. **Follow-up 2026-10-06.** Ticks now come from an injected `ISamplingTicker` (production: `PeriodicTimer` wrapper), so scripted-gap tests prove dilation firing and silence deterministically. The firing test is one-sided: a scripted gap can only grow under host load, never shrink below threshold. The silence test runs at the single-sourced production cadence (`WorkingSetPeakMonitor.DefaultSamplingInterval`, 25 ms) rather than a one-hour stand-in, and asserts the verdict for the gap actually observed — silent under the 4x threshold, reported past it — so a contended host cannot flake it.
2. **Mock Multi-Run Timing Gap Heuristic** ([ControlledDubbingBenchmarkRunnerTests.cs](Trackdub/tests/Trackdub.Benchmarks.Tests/ControlledDubbingBenchmarkRunnerTests.cs)): The assertion `persisted - available < 500` expects tight task continuation scheduling; severe runner thread starvation can dilate async delays.
   - **Resolved 2026-10-06.** The test now ties the bound to the outlier scale structurally: the sequenced outlier delay is a named 2000 ms and the assertion is `gap < outlier / 2`. A median contaminated by the outlier would read >= ~2000 ms while the true p50 gap is ~30 ms, so the bound asserts ordering (p50 excludes the outlier) with ~1 s of margin on both sides instead of a wall-clock budget dispatch overhead could cross.

### 4. QUALITY: 8.5 / 10

**Evaluation**:
- Modern C# 13 / .NET 10 patterns (collection expressions, file-scoped namespaces, pattern matching).
- Zero external runtime dependencies introduced.
- Strict enforcement of `Path.Join` over banned `Path.Combine`.

**Identified Gaps**:
1. **Repetitive Exception Filters** ([WorkingSetPeakMonitor.cs](Trackdub/src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/WorkingSetPeakMonitor.cs)): Multiple catch blocks write identical diagnostics to `unavailableReason`.
   - **Resolved 2026-10-06.** The monitor's sampling filter already collapses to a single `catch (Exception) when (...)` via `TelemetryExceptionFilters`; the finding's remaining live instances were `SeparationEvalRunner`'s per-job (9 blocks) and setup (8 blocks) catches, now each a single filtered catch routing to `CreateFailedResult` / `ReportSetupFailure`. Caller-requested cancellation keeps its rethrow arm ahead of the filter; unrequested cancellations stay job failures. Exact type sets preserved.
2. **Legacy/Typed Telemetry Dual-Mapping** ([ControlledDubbingBenchmarkRunner.cs](Trackdub/src/Trackdub.Benchmarks/ControlledDubbingBenchmarkRunner.cs)): Dual population of legacy memory dictionary keys alongside typed structured telemetry records.
   - **Resolved 2026-10-06 (single-sourced); superseded 2026-10-06 (removed).** The map was first assembled once in `BuildLegacyMemoryBytes`; it is now removed outright. `BenchmarkEvidenceReport` schema v2 replaces it with typed records: `ProcessMemory` (run-level endpoint working sets, sampled peak, whole-run managed allocation, and GC deltas) and `StageGarbageCollection` (per-stage GC deltas). Per-stage working-set peaks and managed allocation were already carried by the typed `ResourceTelemetry` checks and `ResourceDistribution`. The matrix runner, the markdown/JSON exporter, the repository sanitizer, and the tests now read the typed records; no string-keyed memory surface remains.
