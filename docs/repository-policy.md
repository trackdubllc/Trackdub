# Repository Policy

## Organization

This repository (`trackdubllc/Trackdub`) contains the public core of the
Trackdub dubbing engine: SDK, CLI, pipeline, inference, media processing,
infrastructure, and neutral licensing mechanisms.

Licensed under Apache-2.0 (see [LICENSE](../LICENSE) and [NOTICE](../NOTICE)).

## Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the dependency direction rules in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
- Run `dotnet build Trackdub.slnx -m:1` and `dotnet test Trackdub.slnx -m:1`
  before submitting changes.
- Use imperative commit titles: `Add ...`, `Fix ...`, `Remove ...`
- Changes that affect model governance must update the bundled manifest.
- Cross-platform compatibility is a requirement for all changes.

## Model Governance

Only ONNX models with verified commercial licenses are used. The bundled model
manifest is the single source of truth. Unknown or non-commercial licenses are
treated as unsafe and blocked.

## Native Dependencies

Downloaded native binaries (DLLs, dylibs, SOs, FFmpeg, libmpv, EP bundles) are
not tracked in this repository. Manifests, URLs, hashes, and acquisition scripts
are tracked instead.

## Agent Instructions

[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) is the canonical instruction file for automated
contributors. It defines the dependency graph, build commands, coding style,
testing requirements, and model governance rules.
